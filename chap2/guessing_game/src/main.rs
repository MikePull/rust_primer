            Switching from an expect call to a match expression is 
            how you generally move from crashing on an error to HANDLING the error. 
            Remember that parse returns a Result type and Result is an enum 
            that has the variants Ok or Err. Weâ€™re using a match expression here, 
            as we did with the Ordering result of the cmp method.
