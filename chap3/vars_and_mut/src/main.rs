        Mutability can be very useful. 
        Variables are immutable only by default;
        You can make them mutable by adding mut in front of the variable name. 

        In addition to allowing this value to change, 
        mut conveys intent to future readers of the code 
        by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing 
        this variableâ€™s value.

        From an event-driven standpoint and taking from "static" "public" and "private" keywords 
        Mutation can always be looked at through the dichotomy of pipelining a user's inputs and outputs
        to a state tree before being submitted within a payload.
